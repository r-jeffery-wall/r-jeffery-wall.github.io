            "description": "This app was built from a Codecademy portfolio project. It is a React-Redux app that interfaces with the Reddit api to deliver posts and comments to the user, as well as lists of Subreddits. I used Bootstrap for the first time with this project and found that it streamlined my layout and styling workflow. I enjoyed building reducers using Redux toolkit and am really proud of the final result. There were some things I didn't have time to fully implement, such as routing, but I'd like to revist and improve this one.",

This was done in Python and I began using the PySimpleGUI library for the GUI with the SQL interface handled by psycopg2. I then developed this into a web-app by using Streamlit. This was then built as a Docker image and deployed as a web-app using Kubernetes and Terraform. I also worked to implement continuous integration principles to this project.",
