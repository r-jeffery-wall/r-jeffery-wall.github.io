                <p>I have always had an interest in coding, but in the last year or so I have been dedicated to learning a variety of full-stack technologies and building projects in both a professional and hobbyist capacity. I have enjoyed learning a variety of technologies and using projects as a learning tool and a way to discover new technologies. Below you can find a few examples of key projects I have worked on, and a full list of my work can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/r-jeffery-wall" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
                <p>Alongside coding and web development, my hobbies include gaming, photography, and board games.</p>
                <p>This site is actively under construction and will change and evolve as my skills grow and I learn new technologies. The current iteration of this site uses React 18.</p>
