# Rowan's Portfolio Page.
This is the source code for my portfolio page where I showcase my skills and projects.

## Project Details
The current iteration of this project is implemented using React/Redux and Typescript. I have also built a Django backend to serve skills, projects, and socials data. I use the built-in Django admin page to interact with and update this data.

## Next Steps
- Refactor Django backend to use best practices (uploading of images from admin page, etc.)
- Add additional features to the site.
