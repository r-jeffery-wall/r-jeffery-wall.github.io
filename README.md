# Rowan's Portfolio Page.
This is the source code for my portfolio page where I showcase my skills and projects.

## Project Details
The current iteration of this project is implemented using React/Redux and Typescript. Currently I have supplied primarily static data to Redux (barring the GitHub API integration). It is my intention to implement a backend that will serve dynamic data.

## Next Steps
- Implement a Django back-end to store and modify dynamic data for the page (project lists, skills, etc.)
